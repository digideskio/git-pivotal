  Background:
    Given I have a Pivotal Tracker feature

  Scenario: Executing with no settings
    When I run `git-feature`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      Pivotal Tracker API Token and Project ID are required
      """
    And the exit status should be 1

    When I run `git-feature -k 10bfe281783e2bdc2d6592c0ea21e8d5 -p 52815 -D`
    Then the output should contain:
